## 3. Building the Virtual Target:

<b>Obtaining the Windows 10 Image:</b> I downloaded a legitimate Windows 10 ISO file from Microsoft's website, providing the building blocks for my virtual machine.

<b>Setting Up the VM:</b> Using VMWare Player, I configured a new virtual machine and loaded the Windows 10 ISO. I configured the network adapter to be bridged, ensuring it communicated with my actual network for accurate scanning.

<b>Verifying Connectivity:</b> To confirm accessibility, I pinged the virtual machine from outside its environment, validating its presence on the network.

<b>Disabling the Firewall (Within the VM): To ensure scan completion in this controlled testing environment, I temporarily disabled the firewall within the Windows 10 VM.</b> Caution: In real-world scenarios, disabling firewalls is strongly discouraged as it significantly increases security risks. Instead, configure firewall rules to allow necessary traffic for scanning.''
